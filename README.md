# Cloud-hosted web application for a car dealership's review platform

# Background
This application was developed for the final capstone project for IBM's Fullstack-Developer Course on Coursera. The base design for the application was provided by Coursera.The project had been peer-reviewed after submission, as such I did not spend too much time cleaning up the front end as I have concentrated on implementing the backend as specificed by instructors.

# Requirements
The goal was to create a website where users could choose a Best Car dealership to read reviews from other users and submit their own. The site included essential features like a navigation bar and static "About" and "Contact" pages. It was developed using the Python-Django full stack web framework and deployed on the IBM Cloud using Red Hat OpenShift/Kubernetes.
